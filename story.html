<p>The soul of Indian mythology is beyond the simple good and evil. If one cares to dig deep, there’s an interesting story at each and every step. Ravana played the role of a villain.
Ravana was the grandson of Pulastya, one of the greatest sages of Indian mythology and one of the Saptarishis. He was born to<b> Sage Vishravan</b> and Asura’s mother<b> Kaikashi</b>. Hence he is considered <b>half Asur </b>(demon) and <b>half Brahmin</b> (sage). Ravana is known as the supreme antagonist in the ancient Hindu epic Ramayana. He is depicted as a Rakshasa (demon) and the great king of Lanka. He is known as a demon with ten heads, but not many people know that he was not born with ten heads.</p>
<p><b>Ravana actually was a great follower of Lord Shiva, an inordinate scholar, an excellent ruler, and the maestro of the veena</b> (plucked string instrument). He had written two books:<b> the Ravana Samhita</b> (a book of astrology) and <b>Arka Prakasham</b> (book of Siddha medicine). He was well versed in Ayurveda and dark practices of black magic. It is said that he could control the planetary positions at his will. He owned pushpakviman (a flying chariot) which he won from his step brother Kuber. He had mastered tantra vidya (science of creating optical illusions of thoughts) which he used in battles against his enemies.</p>
<p>Once when Ravana tried to lift Mount Kailash, Lord Shiva crushed his forehand beneath the mountain and then Ravana starting chanting praise of Lord Shiva and asked for forgiveness. Lord Shiva was so pleased with Ravana that he stated dancing with all fury and passion and this dance is called tandav and the chants came to be known as<b> “The Shiva Tandav Strotram”</b>. </p>
<p><b>He was a master of 64 types of knowledge and all arts of weaponry</b> and Ravana’s 10 heads are the 10 emotions Once, the great king Mahabali advised Ravana to shun these nine emotions and to keep only intellect to which he justifies that the possession of all these facets are equally important and makes him a complete man. The one head of Buddhi controlled his destiny and the other heads of Ravana controlled his actions which ultimately led to his destruction. He eventually became a slave to his senses and since he could not control his desires, he not only destroyed himself and his clan but the whole Lanka was reduced to ashes. Having all this knowledge but not being able to harness his powers was one of his biggest regrets he had as he lay dying in the battlefield.</p>
